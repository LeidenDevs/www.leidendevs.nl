Originally started in 2015 as a meetup group for developers in Leiden by Stefano Masini, we've grown into a vibrant community that values openness, inclusion, and shared growth - in skills, roles, and perspectives.

Currently organized by Bas, Adrien and Luke, our regular meetups create opportunities to share ideas, grow together, and support the local tech scene. Whether you're debugging code, exploring CI/CD practices, discussing product strategy, or advancing your career, you'll find engaging conversations and meaningful connections.

Our community welcomes everyone from seasoned professionals to those just starting their tech journey. Through our meetups and ongoing conversations, we foster an environment where real people tackle real problems through thoughtful tech discussions.
Join us - where tech minds meet and grow together in Leiden.
