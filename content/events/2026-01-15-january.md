Talk by Kristoffer Dalby from [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)

## Headscale & Tailscale: The complementary open source clone

[Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) started as a learning project to re-implement a Tailscale control server and unexpectedly became a popular open-source alternative for the self-hosted and homelab community.

In this talk, I’ll explain how Headscale and Tailscale coexist despite that overlap, the challenges of being a paid open-source contributor, and how corporate support has helped Headscale grow sustainably.
