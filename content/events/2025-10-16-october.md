## Approval Testing: A Better Way to Test Complex Outputs

Join us for October's meetup where Erik will explore approval testing—a testing approach that simplifies verification of complex outputs and catches regressions you might otherwise miss.

### What to expect:

- Introduction to approval testing concepts
- Practical examples and discussion

### Who should attend

This talk is for anyone working to improve the quality and reliability of the software they build — or support. Whether you're a developer dealing with tricky test cases, refactoring legacy code, in QA, or a product owner looking to better understand the testing process, you'll find practical takeaways here. Curious minds welcome — technical or not.
