One year in, and just warming up!

Summer’s here, and so is the next edition of our monthly software meetup. It’s been a year since we rebooted, and we're keeping the momentum going. Come celebrate with us this June to connect with others in tech, share what you’ve been working on, and reflect on how far we’ve come.
